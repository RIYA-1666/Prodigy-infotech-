A Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, providing both encryption and decryption functionalities. This project includes a user-friendly command-line interface for easy interaction.

Caesar Cipher in Python
This repository contains a Python script that implements the classic Caesar Cipher. It's a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Features
Encryption: Shifts the letters of the input text by a specified number to encrypt the message.
Decryption: Reverses the encryption process to retrieve the original text from the encrypted message.
Command-Line Interface: Easy to use command-line prompts for inputting text, shift value, and choosing the operation.
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the script using Python 3.x.
Follow the on-screen prompts:
Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Enter the shift value (number of positions letters should be shifted).
Choose the operation ('encrypt' or 'decrypt').
Example
Enter the message: Hello World!
Enter the shift value: 3
Choose 'encrypt' or 'decrypt': encrypt
The encrypted text is: Khoor Zruog# Prodigy-infotech-
